Candidates
==========

Candidates represent applicants to the organization.
They're geared towards student applicants, including attributes like
their gpa and, if applicable, undergraduate education. 
Documents can also be associated with specific candidates, 
so things like cv's and portfolios can be included as well. 

They're managed by reviewers, who review their credentials for whether or 
not they should be admitted.
